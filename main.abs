This study investigates regional space weather phenomena in central Mexico by isolating local geomagnetic responses from their planetary counterparts. Through the analysis of 20 intense geomagnetic storms, we discerned the ionospheric contributions within regional geomagnetic data recorded in central Mexico. Our findings underscore the predominant role of ionospheric disturbances in driving local geomagnetic responses. Notably, the \emph{Disturbed Polar Current Number 2} and the \emph{Disturbed Dynamo Current} emerged as particularly influential factors in regional geomagnetic activity. Importantly, our research establishes that regional geomagnetic responses can be accurately approximated by considering the combined impacts of planetary geomagnetic responses and the magnetic perturbations prompted by the aforementioned ionospheric currents.
